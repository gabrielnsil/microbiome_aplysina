Marine sponges are ancient animals that have a broad capacity for association with microorganisms. Within the sponge microbiome, bacteria and archaea are the most important fractions, with several roles in the physiology and fitness of these invertebrates. However, little is known about how seasonal environmental variations impact this prokaryotic community. Here, we are researching the prokaryotic composition of the sponge Aplysina fulva, from Praia Preta (São Sebastião/SP), over a year.
