Marine sponges are ancient animals that have a broad capacity for association with microorganisms. Within the sponge microbiome, bacteria and archaea are the most important fractions, with several roles in the physiology and fitness of these invertebrates. However, little is known about how seasonal environmental variations impact this prokaryotic community. Here, we investigated the prokaryotic composition of the sponge Aplysina fulva, from Praia Preta (São Sebastião/SP), over a year. Five samples were collected for each of the seasons, from May 2019 (autumn) to January 2020 (summer). Illumina sequencing of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was performed, and the sequences processed using the USEARCH-UNOISE3 pipeline and classified with BLCA. Alpha diversity indicators like Shannon, Simpson, CHAO, ACE among others were used. The nMDS approach was used for understand the change in composition during the analyzed period. Over the year, Proteobacteria and Chloroflexota comprised most of the abundance at the phylum level, followed by a poorly classified fraction. The main indicators of alpha diversity in A. fulva remained stable throughout the year. The nMDS approach separated the samples collected in the autumn and summer into conspicuous groups. The partial analyses performed indicate that the prokaryotic community of A. fulva has stability in species richness and diversity. However, there is a change in species composition over the winter and spring.
